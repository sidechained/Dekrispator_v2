This is a fork of the original Dekrispator project, where the original synth code has been swapped out for c code generated by [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr]).

# Usage Instructions

Write or copy some simple Faust code using the [Faust Online IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr). When complete, export the code using the truck icon using the following settings:

- File Name: 'mydsp'
- Platform 'source'
- Architecture 'c'

Click 'compile', then 'download', then copy the contents of the downloaded folder into the Synth directory of this repo.

# UI -> MIDI UI

Faust code is typically developed using a simple onscreen User Interface with buttons/sliders etc. The aim is to swap out this interface for the existing MIDI control interface provided by Dekrispator.

In our case we are using the Korg NanoKontrol2 and have modified the original MIDI_Application.c/.h to create a simple Control Change (CC) and Note mapping for all NanoKontrol2 controls. These call functions which can be inserted into the Faust code, replacing the original user interface code elements.

# Further Aims:

- Make into an official architecture file
- Make drivers for MEMs microphone and accellerometer/tilt sensors
